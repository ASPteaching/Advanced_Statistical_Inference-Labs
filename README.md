# Statistical_Inference-Labs
A repository with examples intended to show how to use R to illustrate statistical concepts or to study properties of statistical procedures using simulation.

The examples have been developed to suport the course "Advanced Statistical Inference" at the UPC-UB joint MSc on Statistics and Operations Research but can be con sidered general purpose exercises.
