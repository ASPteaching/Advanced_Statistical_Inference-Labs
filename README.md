# Advancec Statistical Inference

This repository contains materials used in the course "Advanced Statistical Inference" at the UPC-UB joint MSc on Statistics and Operations Research. 

The examples are not on how to analyze data but, instead, on 
  - how to use R to illustrate statistical concepts
  - how to use R to perform statistical procedures that may require computing such as bootstrapping, permutation tests or the EM algorithm.
  
 This has to be considered "work in progress" so feel free to let me know about any mistakes or improvements.
